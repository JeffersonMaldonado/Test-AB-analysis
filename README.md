# Test-AB-analysis

In this project I will use the A / B test to analyze the data of an e-commerce, to test hypotheses and find out if the old page has more conversion than the new page. In the end, I will test with the logistic regression technique, to find out if the results will be the same.

I will use statistical techniques to find out the p-value and the z-score in order to understand if the data are statistically significant.

## Requirements

### Python

- pandas==0.24.2
- numpy==1.20.0
